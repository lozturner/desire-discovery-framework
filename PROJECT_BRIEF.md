# PROJECT BRIEF: Desire Discovery Framework

## OVERVIEW
This project aims to create a comprehensive framework to help people answer the overwhelming question "what do you want?" by breaking it down into concrete, actionable steps.

## THE PROBLEM
When people are told they can have "anything they want," most freeze because:
- The question is too abstract and clashes with existing constraints
- People default to thinking about limitations (money, time, responsibilities) rather than pure desire
- Many have only chased "means" goals (job titles, salaries, possessions) without defining real "end" goals (experiences, growth, contribution, feelings)
- Values are often implicit and never articulated

## THE SOLUTION
A structured framework that uses targeted questions to:
1. Expose what actually matters to the person
2. Surface implicit values and make them explicit
3. Transform abstract desires into concrete life specifications
4. Create testable versions of what "anything" would look like

## KEY COMPONENTS

### 1. Better Question Set
Replace "anything you want?" with:
- "If nothing could fail, what would you go all-in on for the next 3-5 years?"
- "What would be worth doing even if it failed?"
- "What would your ideal typical day look like?"

### 2. Values Discovery
- Peak moments analysis: "Tell me about a time life felt like it couldn't get any better"
- Burning house exercise: "Which three objects would you save and why?"
- Identify 5-7 core values that define the ideal life

### 3. Concrete Specifications
- Define 3 life goals that would make the biggest difference in 3 years
- Identify what you're willing to sacrifice or stop doing
- Create a testable first version of desired life

## DELIVERABLES
- GitHub repository with framework documentation
- Business models presentation for decision-making frameworks
- Implementation guide and worksheets

## NEXT STEPS
- Develop detailed methodology
- Create practical tools and templates
- Test with real users
- Refine based on feedback
